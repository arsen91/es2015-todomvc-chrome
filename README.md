# Vanilla ES6 (ES2015) â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

This is a fork of https://github.com/addyosmani/es2015-todomvc-chrome Addy Osmani's vanilla es6 TodoMVC. 

It's made with modules in commonjs style, so it requires transpiler. This fork uses Babel+Webpack for module system.

Also one of the intents was to write tests for this project.
